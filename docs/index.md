## Getting started with the Bazze API

The API is located at:  [https://redoc.bazze.io](https://redoc.bazze.io).
In JSON format:  [https://api.bazze.io/v1/openapi.json](https://api.bazze.io/v1/openapi.json).

Most of the time, API's are used by developers as an "integration point" for an application.  API's can also be used on their own for testing and to see what the raw responses look like without the larger application.

There are a few different ways to test out the API.  For example, you can use:

- Command line utilities such as `curl`
- Programming languages such as _Python_ or _Javascript_
- Graphical interfaces such as _Insomnia_ or _Postman_
- The built in Swagger Web Page.

The **Swagger Web Page** is the easiest way to get started since it requires no additional software or programming skills.  Once comfortable with the web page, we recommend switching to a more powerful graphical tool such as _Insomnia_.  

This guide focuses on getting started using the **Swagger Web Page**.
